# ColdFusion in Markdown

This VSCode extension adds better support for ColdFusion in Markdown.

## Dependencies

- You must install a plugin that adds language support for CFML, such as [this one](https://github.com/KamasamaK/vscode-cfml).

## Features

- CFML syntax highlighting in fenced code blocks based on [this](https://github.com/mjbvz/vscode-fenced-code-block-grammar-injection-example) repository.
- CFScript syntax highlighting in fenced code blocks. Grammar is based on the one used by [this extension](https://github.com/KamasamaK/vscode-cfml).

## Future Additions

- Syntax highlighting in markdown preview via a markdown-it plugin. See the [VSCode documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/extension-guides/markdown-extension#adding-support-for-new-syntax-with-markdownit-plugins).
